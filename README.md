To run it, you should write some params when you are trying to call the .jar separated by spaces.

 1. remoteClusterTopologyName
 2. KloutKey
 3. dandelionKey
 4. TwitterConsumerKey
 5. TwitterConsumerSecret
 6. TwitterAccessToken
 7. TwitterAccessToken

You can modify the file src/main/java/TwitterTopologia.java to add TwitterParams and Dandelion/Klout Key. You can add ClusterTopologyName too, but I don't recommend it.
